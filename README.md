<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, my team and I set out to create a model that could predict product performance (measure by product profit) in a fictitious US supermarket based on product region, state, segment, category, and returned status. This was our first experience working with machine learning tools, and we decided to perform the analysis for the project in R, which was a new language to us at the time. We split our analysis up by region, with the Southern Region being my responsibility. I also became responsible for spearheading the development of the machine learning model and the mosaic plots for the project.<br/>
<br/>
While we did find correlation between our variables of interest and the product performance of existing products, we struggled to generate a machine learning model that could accurately predict product price. This was, in my eyes, due to my inexperience with working with machine learning models and the large number of categorical variables in the dataset that required encoding.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these hurdles, I learned a lot about visualization in R using ggplot and the process of machine learning modelling, further accelerating my proficiency as a data scientist. <br/>
